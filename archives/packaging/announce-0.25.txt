Hello everyone,
The new fpdb release 0.25 is now available for download as source or as packages/installers for Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu and Windows. This version brings many improvements and bugfixes, we listed some of them later on.

So... what is FPDB?
===================
FPDB (Free Poker Database) is a free/open source suite of steadily growing tools to track and analyse your online poker game. FPDB is able to import the hand histories that poker sites write to your computer and to store additional data from each hand in a database for use in later analysis.

FPDB is ambitious, intending to support all games. Currently we support flop based games (Holdâ€™em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo), stud games (7 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo, and Razz) and draw games (Triple Draw Lowball, 5 Card Draw) on most major poker sites.

FPDB provides a Heads Up Display (HUD), Profit Grapher and Stats viewers with a list of features that is growing.

373 changesets (incl. merges) have gone in since 0.24. Some of the improvements are:

How to download/update
======================
Please note that you will have to either recreate your database or use a new one if you're updating from 0.24 or older. Fpdb will warn you if your database is incompatible and will not work properly unless you recreate or use a new one.
Config files from 0.20 and later should work. Please report if you have problems with config files from that version or later.
You can find checksums (MD5 and SHA512) in the download folder.

How to get help
===============
Please also see the "Bug reports" section below to enable us to help you.
These are listed in order of usefulness - the 2+2 thread in particular is rather chaotic so if we miss your post feel free to bring it up again
1) Chat/IRC
One of the developers is usually around, but it is IRC. Dont get discouraged because we didn't answer within 10 minutes, once we do you've probably got our full attention.
This link takes you to a website where you can talk to us directly: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fpdb
Alternatively use can use any IRC client to connect to #fpdb on freenode.net

3) The monster 2+2 forum thread (registration required).
http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/16...2009-a-273001/ Please dont let the size of the thread phase you. It is monitored and sends email notifications to some of the developers. (Note: If you play poker and don't frequent the 2+2 forums, you may want to become better acquainted. Its a bit daunting at first, but well worth the effort)

Bug reports
===========
When you do report issues, try to make it easier for us help you. We usually need at least the following information:

- Database type (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Install method (exe, tarball, deb, git, ebuild)
- Fpdb version
