Hello everyone,
The new fpdb release 0.22 is now available for download as source or as packages/installers for Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu and Windows.
This version brings many improvements and bugfixes. A quick word on our version naming: We have decided to stop using the usual alpha/beta/rc release system as it doesn't suit fpdb's development style and resources. From now on all releases are created equal (ie. considered "testing"). If they proof themselves we declare them "stable" and make them the default download on sourceforge. If you wish to be notified of new releases or stabilisation please subscribe to the fpdb-announe mailing list (see Links further down). Since this version has been available for some time we consider it stable and recommend all users to update.

So... what is FPDB?
===================
FPDB (Free Poker Database) is a free/open source suite of steadily growing tools to track and analyse your online poker game. FPDB is able to import the hand histories that poker sites write to your computer and to store additional data from each hand in a database for use in later analysis.

FPDB is ambitious, intending to support all games. Currently we support flop based games (Holdâ€™em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo), stud games (7 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo, and Razz) and draw games (Triple Draw Lowball, 5 Card Draw) on most major poker sites.

FPDB provides a Heads Up Display (HUD), Profit Grapher and Stats viewers with a list of features that is growing.

What's changed
==============
417 changesets (incl. merges) have gone in since 0.21-rc2. Some of the improvements are:

New stats:
    Three bet: name="three_B"  (note this stat was previously "three_B_0")
    Four bet: name="four_B"
    Cold four bet: name="cfour_B"
    Squeeze bet preflop: name="squeeze"
    Fold to three bet preflop: name="f_3bet"

    Steal Success : name="s_steal"

Where to get it

Config files from 0.20 and later should work. Please report if you have problems with config files from that version or later.

How to get help
===============
Please also see the "Bug reports" section below to enable us to help you.
These are listed in order of usefulness - the 2+2 thread in particular is rather chaotic so if we miss your post feel free to bring it up again
1) Chat/IRC
One of the developers is usually around, but it is IRC. Dont get discouraged because we didn't answer within 10 minutes, once we do you've probably got our full attention.
This link takes you to a website where you can talk to us directly: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fpdb
Alternatively use can use any IRC client to connect to #fpdb on freenode.net
2) Mailing List
Visit http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fpdb-main to subscribe to the development&support mailing list and send us an email
3) The monster 2+2 forum thread (registration required).
http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/16...2009-a-273001/ Please dont let the size of the thread phase you. It is monitored and sends email notifications to some of the developers. (Note: If you play poker and don't frequent the 2+2 forums, you may want to become better acquainted. Its a bit daunting at first, but well worth the effort)

Bug reports
===========
When you do report issues, try to make it easier for us help you. We usually need at least the following information:
- Operating system and version (e.g. Ubuntu 10.10 or Windows XP)
- Database type (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Install method (exe, tarball, deb, git, ebuild)
- Fpdb version
- Site name and gametype (e.g. $10 Pokerstars Razz SnG)
You can find most of these details for easy copy&paste in the Help menu under About.

Important known problems
========================
Hud will not work if using postgres database - fixed in 0.23
PKR is not working correctly

Special information for Windows installations
=============================================
First-time installs will need to download and install the C++ runtime executable from Microsoft.
Windows 7 and windows Vista users will need to set fpdb.exe and hud_main.exe to run as administrator (see http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/fpdb/index.php?title=Install_in_Windows)
