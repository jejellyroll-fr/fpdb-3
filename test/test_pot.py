"""
Main functionalities:
The Pot class represents a pot in a poker game. It keeps track of the players who are still in the pot, the amount of money each player has committed to the pot, the common money in the pot, the antes, the total amount of money in the pot, and the side pots. It also provides methods for adding and removing players, adding money to the pot, and calculating the total amount of money in the pot.
