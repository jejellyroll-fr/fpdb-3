########################################################################

#    How to write a new stat:
#        0  Do not use a name like "xyz_2". Names ending in _ and a single digit are
#           used to indicate the number of decimal places the user wants to see in the Hud.
#        1  You can see a listing of all the raw stats (e.g., from the HudCache table)
#           by running Database.py as a stand along program.  You need to combine
#           those raw stats to get stats to present to the HUD.  If you need more
#           information than is in the HudCache table, then you have to write SQL.
#        2  The raw stats seen when you run Database.py are available in the Stats.py
#           in the stat_dict dict.  For example the number of vpips would be
#           stat_dict[player]['vpip'].  So the % vpip is
#           float(stat_dict[player]['vpip'])/float(stat_dict[player]['n']).  You can see how the
#           keys of stat_dict relate to the column names in HudCache by inspecting
#           the proper section of the SQL.py module.
#           The stat_dict keys should be in lower case, i.e. vpip not VPIP, since
#           postgres returns the column names in lower case.
#        3  You have to write a small function for each stat you want to add.  See
#           the vpip() function for example.  This function has to be protected from
#           exceptions, using something like the try:/except: paragraphs in vpip.
#        4  The name of the function has to be the same as the of the stat used
#           in the config file.
#        5  The stat functions have a peculiar return value, which is outlined in
#           the do_stat function.  This format is useful for tool tips and maybe
#           other stuff.
#        6  All stats receive two params (stat_dict and player) - if these parameters contain
#           "None", the stat must return its description in tuple [5] and must not traceback
#        7  Stats needing values from the hand instance can find these in _global_hand_instance.foo
#           attribute
